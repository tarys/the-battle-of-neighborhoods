    "Nowadays working at office or home office is one of the most frequent setups. In most cases such type of work requires seating for multiple hours a day, which brings very unhealthy static tension to the body.  \n",
    "There are multiple types of sport activities to eliminate and compensiate such bad influence, one of very popular is yoga.
